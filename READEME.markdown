HTML5 Slides
============
HTML5 Slides is a spin-off of Google I/O's presentation from 2011. Easily replace Powerpoint or Keynote and create your next presentation easily using simple HTML.

Usage
-----

### Basic
 1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:sethvargo/html5-slides.git`
 2. Add your slide data to `index.html`. Each slide is wrapped in an html `<article>` tag. There are many examples provided in `index.html` for you to base your slides on.

# Advanced (Custom Theme)
 1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:sethvargo/html5-slides.git`
 2. Add your slide data to `index.html`.
 3. Open `stylesheets/styles.css` and change the CSS to suit your needs.

Notes
-----
 - I did not write any of this javascript or styling - I merely compiled it from Google, Eric Meyers, etc. I take no credit, and I've cited all JS/CSS appropriately.
